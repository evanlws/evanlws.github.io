	<h2>print("Hello")</h2>
	<p>My name is Evan Lewis and I'm an iOS engineer. I started building apps for iOS 6 and since then, I've made a lot of apps (that probably aren't all listed here) currently on the iOS and Mac App Store using both Objective-C and Swift. I am always open to hearing about full time iOS development positions, so if you're interested, <a href="#contact"><strong><u>let's talk!</u></strong></a></p>
	<p>I currently have a full time iOS Engineer in New York, but listed below are my past and current side projects.</p>

							<div class="main-content">
								<p class="light-font"><em>Musicality - Never Miss a Beat</em> is among one of my most ambitious projects to date. The app scans the user's music library and allows them to be notified whenever an artist releases new music. I created this app because I felt like I
									was always missing out on new music by my favorite artists. There are so many newer artists in the music scene, it's hard to keep up!</p>
								<p>Written in <strong>Objective-C</strong>, I've used a variety of different tools and frameworks for this iOS App. Musicality first uses the built in MPMediaLibrary to get the users song information, then the <strong>iTunes Search API</strong>										to match the library with the items in iTunes. It also fetches and parses <strong>JSON</strong> and <strong>XML</strong> data using the NSXMLParser. The app also uses <strong>Crashlytics</strong> for crash reports, part of Twitter's Fabric framework.
									The UI was built using <strong>UIKit</strong>, storyboards and xib files.</p>

								<p class="light-font"><em>Twenty Five: A Minimalist Productivity Timer</em> was created in order to improve productivity, without being obtrusive. Twenty Five does exactly that. It was originally an app I created for myself, to help focus on the task at hand and increase my overall productivity. It's a very simple but extremely effective macOS App.</p>
								<p>Written in <strong>Objective-C</strong>, it's a small app that utilizes the <strong>system menu bar</strong> and <strong>NSTimer</strong>.</p>

							<div class="main-content">
								<p class="light-font"><em>Top Marks</em> was an iOS app I created because I wanted an easy way to keep track of my grades. The biggest challenge was designing the user experience. I wanted it to be simple but compatible with a variety of education institutions.</p>
								<p>I originally began working on this in Objective-C, but I since decided it would be good practice to try and create Top Marks 100% using <strong>Swift</strong>. I'm using <strong>UIKit</strong> storyboards and xib files for the UI and <strong>CoreData</strong> for the backend</p>
